ABOUT THIS PROGRAM

I created this Rock, Paper, Scissors program as part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. 

HOW IT WORKS

It allows the user to select a choice between Rock, Paper, Scissors and compares it against the computer's random selection. It will allow for 5 turns and whoever has more wins ends up victorious (an alert will be generated with the final scores.)
