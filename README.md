I created this little Rock, Paper, Scissors program as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. 

It allows the user to input a choice between Rock, Paper, Scissors and compares it against the computer's choice. It will allow for 5 turns and whoever has more wins ends up victorious. 

I had many challenges while working this project since it was my very first time working with a programming language, but it allowed me to learn as I was trying to figure out why my functions didn't work.

I will probably continue to add to this project as well as revisit later to improve it.
