ABOUT THIS PROGRAM

I created this Rock, Paper, Scissors program as part of The Odin Project's Foundations curriculum. 

HOW IT WORKS

It allows the user to select a choice between Rock, Paper, Scissors and compares it against the computer's random selection. It will allow for 5 turns and whoever has more wins ends up victorious (an alert will be generated with the final scores.)

TWO VERSIONS

One of the versions (the one that does not end with "js" in its name) was the very first attempt at creating a simple game using alerts and receiving written input by the user. 
The second version has a simple UI with buttons that the user can click to select their choice.
